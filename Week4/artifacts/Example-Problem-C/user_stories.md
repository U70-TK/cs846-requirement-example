**1. Core Recognition & Wiki Integration**

| User Story # | Description | Story Points | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| 1.01 | As a casual learner, I want to point my camera at an object and have it identified so that I can automatically land on its specific Wikipedia paragraph. | 3 | M | Given: The app is open with the camera active and a clear view of a common object (e.g., a spoon). When: The user centers the object in the viewfinder, and the AI identifies it with high confidence. Then: The app must automatically launch the in-app browser and scroll directly to the relevant descriptive paragraph on the localized Wikipedia page. |
| 1.02 | As a user, I want the identification process to take less than 0.5 seconds so that the experience feels magical and instantaneous. | 5 | S | Given: The user is on a standard high-speed mobile network or Wi-Fi. When: An object is captured in the camera frame. Then: The time elapsed from "Image Capture" to "Identity Displayed" must be <= 0.5 seconds. Then: The UI must maintain a smooth frame rate during this transition to ensure a "theatrical" and "magical" feel. |
| 1.03 | As a researcher, I want the app to generate a "micro-article" if a Wikipedia page doesn't exist so that I still get immediate context about the object. | 8 | S | Given: The AI identifies an object (e.g., a specific prototype) that does not have an existing Wikipedia entry. When: The retrieval engine confirms a 404 or "Page Not Found" status from the Wiki API. Then: The app must trigger a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize a brief, accurate introduction based on identified visual metadata. Then: The generated text must be clearly labeled as "AI-Generated Insight" and include an option for the user to "Submit to Wikipedia". |

**2. Advanced Visual Features**

| User Story # | Description | Story Points | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| 2.01 | As a tech enthusiast, I want a "see-through" visual overlay of internal components (e.g., CPU, RAM) so that I can understand the inner workings of my devices. | 13 | W | Given: The user points the camera at a supported closed device (e.g., a specific laptop or smartphone model). When: The AI identifies the specific make and model. Then: The app must render a "theatrical" AR overlay showing a 3D exploded schematic of the internal components (CPU, RAM, battery) aligned with the physical object. Then: The UI must display an animation of "electrons flowing" or heat maps to create the intended "wow factor". |
| 2.02 | As a style-conscious user, I want the app background to automatically detect and match my phone case's color/texture so the UI feels bespoke. | 13 | W | Given: The user has opted into "Bespoke Theming" during onboarding. When: The user provides a reference image of their phone case (the "case selfie"). Then: The app must analyze and sample the color, texture (e.g., fabric weave), and sheen of the case. Then: The app background must automatically morph to a synthesized matching wallpaper that includes the case's specific gradients or patterns. |

**3. Support & Error Handling**

| User Story # | Description | Story Points | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| 3.01 | As a user, I want to see the top three identification guesses with confidence scores if the AI is uncertain so that I can manually select the correct one. | 2 | M | Given: The AI's primary identification confidence score for an object is below the "Automatic Redirection" threshold (e.g., < 85%). When: The recognition process completes. Then: Instead of redirecting to Wikipedia, the app must display an "Ambiguity View" showing three cards representing the top three guesses. Then: Each card must display the object name and its corresponding confidence percentage (e.g., "Mug - 72%"). When: The user taps one of the cards. Then: The app immediately navigates to the Wikipedia page for that specific selection. |
| 3.02 | As an unsatisfied user, I want a "Report wrong result" flow so that I can help improve the AI's accuracy for future scans. | 3 | M | Given: The app has incorrectly identified an object or the user is on a Wikipedia page that doesn't match their physical object. When: The user taps the "Report wrong result" button. Then: A simple feedback overlay appears, allowing the user to suggest the correct name or select a category. When: The user submits the report. Then: The app must bundle the original image, the AI's guessed label, and the user's feedback, then upload it to the "Failure Case" database. Then: The user must receive a confirmation message (e.g., "Thanks! This helps WikiLens get smarter."). |

**4. Privacy & Accessibility**

| User Story # | Description | Story Points | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| 4.01 | As a privacy-conscious user, I want an option to opt out of server-side logging so that my scanned images are not stored on the cloud. | 3 | M | Given: The user navigates to the "Privacy" section of the app settings. When: The user toggles the "Server-side Logging" switch to the OFF position. Then: Any subsequent images sent to the cloud for recognition must be deleted immediately after the identification result is returned. Then: The system must ensure that these images are not added to the 30-day retention pool or the manual curation pipeline. |
| 4.02 | As a non-English speaker, I want the app to support my native language (top 5 markets) so that I can use the tool effectively regardless of my location. | 5 | C | Given: The app is being used in one of the top five markets (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Hindi, Arabic). When: The user selects their preferred language in the system settings or app settings. Then: All UI elements (buttons, onboarding, error messages) must be displayed in that language. Then: When an object is identified, the app must automatically retrieve and display the Wikipedia entry from that language's specific Wiki subdomain (e.g., es.wikipedia.org). |
